# CSCI2824
This repository contains various topics and examples of my work in Discrete Structures at CU Boulder.

The course covers fundamental ideas from discrete mathematics, especially for computer science students. It focuses on topics that will be foundational for future courses including algorithms, artificial intelligence, programming languages, automata theory, computer systems, cryptography, networks, computer/network security, databases, and compilers.

Topics Covered:
* Logic: Propositional and First Order Logic, Boolean Algebra.
* Proofs: Primer on writing proofs, inductions, proof by contradiction.
* Sets, Relations and Functions: Basic properties. Paradoxes in naive set theory. Infinite sets.
* Recursion: Recursive functions and recursively defined structures.
* Combinatorics: Counting, binomial theorem, counting with recursion.
* Discrete Probability: Basic facts, Bayes' Rule
* Graphs: Definitions and properties of graphs.
* Trees: Definitions and properties of trees.
* Example Applications: Artificial Intelligence (automated reasoning, game playing), Graphics (drawing fractals) and Networks (social network analysis).
